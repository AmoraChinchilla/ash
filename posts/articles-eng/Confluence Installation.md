One of our customers ask the possibility of using Atlassian Confluence as a self-hosted wiki program. We look for solutions for a while. Later on, we discovered Cloudron app. In this article, We'll install Confluence with a custom domain on our servers.

### What is Confluence?
Confluence is a team collaboration and wiki software developed by Australian software company Atlassian. 
It is a web-based application and written in Java programming language.It was released in 2004 (Voav) as an enterprise knowledge management software.

*==You can use it as a team collaboration app, wiki, knowledgebase, blog, intranet etc==*. 

If you read my articles written in Turkish, you realized that talented editor is a must for me in any platform I wrote. The editor of Confluence is one of the best editor in the universe. It has really advanced permission level. You can create many workspaces.

However, Atlassian Cloud doesnâ€™t allow us to use our custom domains and managed Confluence solutions is a bit complicated.

Fortunately, Cloudron made it easier for us to use it on our own servers. By doing this, we can use our own custom domains with Atlassian Confluence app.


### How much does it cost to use Self-Hosted Confluence?

Confluence requires at least 4 GB RAM. Thus, the most expensive cost will the cloud instance.Cloudron is free for personal usage up to 2 apps which is completely sufficient for us.
Therefore, the cost of using Confluence with a custom domain will be:
* **$20/month** Cloud Cost on Digital Ocean + one-time license fee of **$10**.

I'll share a referral links below that gives you some amount of free credits. Thus, It is free to follow this guideline.

### What are the requirements?
* __Digital Ocean Account__: This is the platform that hosts our Confluence server. You can get __free $100 credit__ which is available 60 days if you register with this [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/7eab8594304f).
* __Cloudron Account__: Cloudron provides software solutions for hosting different applications on our servers. You can also get __ $30 free credit__ if you register with this [referral link](https://cloudron.io/?refcode=4c0c9d3f2a2daed6)
* __Domain Name__: You'll need a custom domain.


## Step 1 - Create Droplet with Cloudron 
Our Confluence app will be hosted on the droplet which we will create now. A Droplet is basically a virtual server in Digital Ocean. 

I'm assuming that you have created an DA account and created a project. Now, we'll create a droplet with Cloudron app installed. 

On the left side, you'll find __Marketplace__ link under the __Discover__ section. 

1. Click the marketplace link.  Search and select __Cloudron__. 
![Cloudron on Digital Ocean](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/1-marketplace-selection.jpg)


2. Click __Create Couldron Droplet__ button. 
![Create Cloudron Droplet](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/2-cloudron-selection.jpg)


3. Now, you'll see the droplet settings page. As I told you before, Confluence requires minimum 4 GB RAM. Therefore, we should minimum select Basic plan which costs $20/month. Also, we'll choose the closest datacenter to us and create a password as an authentication method. 
![Cloudron droplet settings](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/3-droplet-settings.jpg)

At the bottom of the page, we'll click the __Create Droplet__ button. It will start the installation of cloud instance and Cloudron application.



## Step - 2) Initial Configurations
We are going to make some domain adjustments. There are two cases for your domain name provider. 
* The nameservers of your domain name are on Digital Ocean.
* Your nameservers are on another provider.

In either case, I'll follow the __manual method__ that fits every case. 


#### DNS Settings
First, visit the project page on Digital Ocean. If any IP number assigned to your instance, note it down. Otherwise, wait till the assignment. For example mine is `46.101.148.85`.

![droplet-ip](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/4-droplet-ip.jpg)

To make illustration, Let say we have a domain [airporttransfer.ist](https://airporttransfer.ist). We also decided to use a subdomain for the Confluence app, let's say __notes.airporttransfer.ist__. 

Second, Whether your DNS provider is DA or not, visit your domain name provider's website. Go to DNS management page of your domain name. 
Add these two '__A records__' that target the IP number we saved above.

| Host | Target |
|------|------|
| notes | 46.101.148.85 |
| my.notes | 46.101.148.85 |

First one is the subdomain name you use with Confluence. Second one is the cloudron panel with a prefix of __my.__ 
Save the records. 

You can control whether your domain is pointing to correct IP by visiting __dnschecker.org__. If the __A record__ points to the correct IP, you can proceed. DNS propagation can take some time. Therefore, this process can took time. 

#### Cloudron settings
Open your browser and paste the IP number of your instance on a new page.

![browser-security-warning](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/5-browser-warning.jpg)

(__Note__: We have not any secure certificate now.Therefore, your browser will warn you about the privacy. This means your connection is not encrypted end-to-end. Open the advanced settings and proceed with unsafe method.)

You'll see Cloudron setup page. 

![cloudron-domain-setup](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/6-cloudron-domain-screen.jpg)

* Write down your domain/subdomain that will be used for Confluence app. 
* Select Manual as DNS Provider. 

Click Next. Now, Cloudron will start to make proper internal configurations. Whet it finishes, you'll fill the admin form. 


#### Confluence Installation 

If we did everyhting right, we see an empt Cloudron page.
On the upper right menu, click App Store. Before this, you fill the login form of Cloudron. 

![confluence-installed-cloudron](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/7-start-confluence.jpg)


Write your credentials and login.
Search Confluence and install it.


## Step - 3) Confluence Settings
I assume that all the settings properly configured. Now, click Confluence app on Cloudron page. 

A setup page welcomes us. Follow the steps below:
* Select __Product Installation__. If you need __Concluence Questions__ or __Confluence Team Calendars__, please also select them. Click Next.

* Press __Get an evaluation license__ link and get the license for Confluence Server. Click Next.
* If you have a database choose __My own database__. Otherwise, you can use built-in database as a temporary solution. Click Next.
* Wait until the database settings are done. Then, create an empty site. 
* Fill the System Administrator Account.
* Give your space a name. For example: "Personal Wiki".

![confluence-empty-page](https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/note-images/confluence-installation/8-final-screen.jpg)

Now, you can use Atlassian Confluence on your domain. You can create a redirection to your space or make your space public. Just configure them on General Configuration.
