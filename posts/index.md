## Known issues

This an early version of MindStone, which mean there are bugs and issues. Below are some known issues, that I plan to work on:
- Image link in wiki link style is not supported yet. `![[Image_link.png]]` will not work yet.  see work around below
- Graphview does not load when clicking on side-bar or click node on graphview, browser reload will refresh it state
- Graph view layout and interaction is still very rough. More UI/UX improvements are needed.
- Transclusion is not working yet.


## Improvements

Future features I have in mind
- [ ] Page Preview like Obsidian Core plugin
- [ ] Full text search with `Cmd + K`
- [ ] Andy Sliding Pane 
- [ ] Infinite canvas for browsing through notes and connections
